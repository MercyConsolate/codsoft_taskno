# **DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP WITH CODSOFT**

#### **(December 15th 2023 to January 15th 2024)**

## **Project Overview**
**Welcome to this Repository! Throughout my one-month internship with CodSoft, I had the opportunity to work on three distinct projects. Here's an overview of each project and the techniques I used to tackle them:**

**Task 1: Predicting Passengers Survival on the Titanic using Decision Tree**
**For this project, I built a predictive model using the decision tree algorithm to determine the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. By analyzing valuable information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more, the decision tree algorithm accurately predicted the survival outcomes of passengers.**

**Task 3: Classifying the Iris Flower into Different Species using Random Forest**
**In this project, I employed the random forest algorithm to classify the famous Iris flower dataset into different species. By taking into consideration attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the random forest algorithm effectively categorized the flowers into their respective species.**

**Task 5: Predict Credit Card Fraud using Logistic Regression**
**For the final project, I utilized logistic regression to predict credit card fraud. With a dataset containing various features related to credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and other anonymized variables, the logistic regression model accurately identified fraudulent transactions.**

##  **Repository Structure**
This GitHub repository is organized as follows:

- **Task1_DecisionTree: Contains the code and relevant files for the Titanic survival prediction task.**

- **Task3_RandomForest: Includes the code and relevant files for the Iris flower species classification task.**

- **Task5_LogisticRegression: Contains the code and relevant files for the credit card fraud prediction task.**

**Feel free to explore each task's directory for detailed code implementation and any additional resources provided.**

## **Conclusion**
**These projects provided me with hands-on experience in implementing different machine learning algorithms and effectively utilizing various datasets. Through these projects, I developed a deeper understanding of decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression algorithms, refining my skills in data analysis, feature selection, and model prediction.**

**Overall, these projects solidified my practical knowledge and allowed me to apply various algorithms to real-world scenarios. I am excited to leverage this experience and continue exploring the endless possibilities in the field of data science.**
